## Installation

The software has been tested with Ros Melodic under Ubuntu 18.04.

Create a new catkin workspace, configure it to build in release, download all dependencies with wstool and build ``perceptive_mpc``.
```
sudo apt install python-catkin-tools libglpk-dev python-wstool -y
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
mkdir perceptive_mpc_ws
cd perceptive_mpc_ws
mkdir src
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/melodic --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd src
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/perceptive_mpc.git
wstool init . ./perceptive_mpc/perceptive_mpc_https.rosinstall
catkin build perceptive_mpc
```

Alternatively, you can also create a docker image by running:
```
docker image build -t perceptive_mpc:v0.3 .
```
or pull the image from dockerhub:
```
docker pull rslethz/perceptive_mpc
```

## Demos

### Motion Planning
The easiest way to test the software is to use the provided launchfiles in the ```perceptive_mpc``` package.


```roslaunch perceptive_mpc demo.launch```:

This will launch a kinematic simulation of the motion planner. The computed optimal state is set as the observation of the MPC. An end-effector target can be set with an interactive marker in RVIZ.

If you use the docker image, run the following commands instead:
```
xhost local:root
docker container run -it --rm --name mpc_demo \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
 --device /dev/dri \
 perceptive_mpc:v0.3 ./src/perceptive_mpc/scripts/run_demo.sh
```

### Collision Avoidance

```roslaunch perceptive_mpc collision_avoidance_demo.launch```:

Launches the MPC controller with collision avoidance. Call the following service to load a Euclidian Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map:

```rosservice call /voxblox_node/load_map "file_path: '/path/to/esdf/map.esdf'"```

An demo map ```example_map.esdf``` is contained in the example directory.

If you use the docker image, run the following commands instead:
```
xhost local:root
docker container run -it --rm --name collision_avoidance_demo \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
 --device /dev/dri \
 perceptive_mpc:v0.3 ./src/perceptive_mpc/scripts/run_demo_collision_avoidance.sh
```
After everything started, load a map by running:
```
docker exec collision_avoidance_demo ./src/perceptive_mpc/scripts/load_map.sh
```
## Mechanical Stability
The ZMP mechanical stability constraint is active by default.
The radius of the support circle (circle inscribing the support polygon) can be set in the task.info configuration file.
In the kinematic simulation, the external wrench is set to a default value specified in the `kinematic_simulation_parameters.yaml` file. The wrench is specified in end-effector reference frame.
By sending a `WrenchPoseTrajectory` message, a time varying wrench can be specified. The wrenches in this message are again specified in the desired end-effector reference frame. The end-effector references themselves need to be specified in world frame.
## Robot integration
The software can easily be integrated with a mobile manipulator platform. The configuration can be copied from ```perceptive_mpc/example/KinematicSimulation.cpp```. The tracker thread is the main control loop. The current state estimate has to be set as the system observation. The optimal control inputs can be forwarded to the motor controllers.

The admittance control module can only be tested on hardware or in a physics based simulation. The source code of ```KinematicSimulation.[h|cpp]``` contains hints on how to interface with the module.

In order to use your custom manipulator, derive from the ```KinematicsInterface``` class and override the purely virtual methods for forward kinematics computation. We provide kinematic implementations for some popular robots:
* Mabi Speedy 12
* UR10
* UR5
* UR3

The kinematics code was generated with [RobCoGen v0.4ad.0](https://robcogenteam.bitbucket.io/index.html).
Robcogen requires robot descriptions in the .kindsl/.dtdsl format. The [urdf2robcogen](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/urdf2robcogen/tree/v1.0) tool converts to this format from .urdf files.
